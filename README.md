# Time Machine Clean

Clean old Time Machine backups with ease! You know, when you have backups from several machines on a single drive and
not a single one wants to backup anymore...

## Installation

Simply install from [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/):

```Bash
$ gem install tmclean
```

## Usage

See the usage by just type `tmclean`:

```Bash
$ tmclean                                                                                                                                                          ruby-1.9.3-p194 1â†µ
Usage: tmclean last <number>
       tmclean keep <number>
       tmclean until <date description>
```

TMClean requires root privileges to delete the Time Machine backups. If you use [RVM](https://rvm.io/),
then you simply can use `rvmsudo`, otherwise use `sudo su -`.
